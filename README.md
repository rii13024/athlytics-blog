# Athlytics - Static Blog

This is a minimal static blog that follows the styling you provided. Posts are rendered from a static array in `script.js` and each post's content is placed inside a `<p>` element as requested. There is no "create post" option.

To view the blog, open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve it from a static host).

Files:
- `index.html` - main page
- `styles.css` - styling
- `script.js` - static posts and rendering

You can edit the `posts` array in `script.js` to change or add posts.
